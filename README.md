# NYSC
NYSC is a compulsory one year service to our motherland NIGERIA. Meaning everybody after their tertiary education must serve the land before they can even work. Now for a scheme that sees millions of graduate pass through in respective of their course of study their site is actually extremly boring. I guess when I was to serve I never took note of it until now when I wanted to clone it. So before further ado let me say sorry for the website it is actually very boring but it is responsive that's a good thing then
